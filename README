# HistomicsTK docker scripts

## Description

This project contains a set of scripts that are convenient to configure,
build, and test histomicsTK in its docker container.

The following environment variables need to be defined for these scripts
to run:

* `HOME`: This should always be defined by the default environment anyway.
* `HISTOMICS_SOURCE_FOLDER`: Points to the location of your HistomicsTK
source directory.
* `HISTOMICS_TESTDATA_FOLDER`: Folder in which the test data will be installed
on the host computer. This allows to not download the test data every time,
but keep a cache of it on the host computer.

# Scripts

* deploy.sh: wrapper script around deploy_docker.py HistomicsTK script to mount
local host source and data folders.
* build.sh: configure and build girder inside docker container to build HistomicsTK
plugin.
* test.sh: Run girder tests inside container.
* connect.sh: convenience script to log in the HistomicsTK docker container.
* cleanbuild.sh: Removes all HistomicsTK docker containers and HistomicsTK files
installed in $HOME/.histomicstj=k. Pulls and rebuilds all the docker containers, and
builds and tests HistomicsTK. This script does not mount any host folder into the
docker image and is intended for debug purpose only.
